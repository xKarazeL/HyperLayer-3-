## 📉 Risk Mitigation

### Token Stability Mechanisms

#### 1. Vesting Schedules
```
Long vesting periods prevent dumps
Team: 4 years
Advisors: 2 years
Public: 6-month cliff
```

#### 2. Burn Mechanisms
```
Deflationary pressure offsets emissions
Multiple burn sources
Permanent reduction in supply
```

#### 3. Liquidity Depth
```
Protocol-owned liquidity
Market maker partnerships
CEX listings
```

#### 4. Utility Demand
```
Gas fees (required for transactions)
Staking (locks supply)
Governance (locks during votes)
Bridge fees (cross-chain transfers)
```

### Economic Attack Vectors

#### Long-Term Value Accrual
```
Staking Rewards → Validator income → Network security
Transaction Fees → Burns → Supply reduction → Price support
Bridge Usage → More burns → Deflationary spiral
Governance → Better protocol → Higher adoption
```
